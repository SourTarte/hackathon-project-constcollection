In some of my works, I juxtapose my models with an image created by myself; a real image with an imagined one, so that two fields become one. Words from poems and images from original paintings have been projected and painted onto the bodies of my daughters, like tattoos that seep into their beings attempting to speak a new story. My artistry is a way to empower my daughters. Each painting shines a light on the stories shared between, with and for daughters and mothers. These stories can be transferred to a larger global context inviting others to think about the stories that our young girls carry with them in our societies today.</span></p><p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-73763848-7fff-c980-7407-1d6fac4ff7bc\"></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;background-color:#ffffff;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:8pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">So, I am not only a painter, but also a storyteller. Each painting is paired with a written narrative, a story that reveals something intimate and essential about my daughters: who they are, who they are becoming, and the quiet magic they hold within. These stories are modern day fairytales, that talk about those very personal issues that our young women are forced to face every day. They tell of a young womans search for courage, for voice, for beauty and imagination and I am sure that they echo the universal longing for all our daughters to be truly seen and understood. As a mother-artist, I feel an urgent responsiblity to preserve and pass on the knowledge of storytelling. In a world increasingly driven by noise and distraction, storytelling, especially through art, becomes a form of resistance, a grounding thread that connects past, present and future. My paintings of my daughters are not just visual objects; they are repositories of growth, of memory, identity and hope. They are a way of saying: �We were here, we lived, we loved and this is what it meant.�</span></p>",

As my body goes through the changes that come with aging, I have had to re-create who I am now as a women and as a mother. �Lilith� is a reflection of this god-awful perimenopausal epoch and is a self-portrait of me at this time. The story of Lilith comes from old Christian scriptures, she was Adam�s first wife. It is said that Lilith was made from the same soil as Adam, thus making them equal. When Lilith asserted her equality and refused to lie under Adam, she was banished from Eden for this disobedience. Lilith fled to the Red Sea wher she turned into a temptress, a breeder of demon spirites and killer of children in the night. (I can relate.) My body has decided, without my consent, to murder my ability to bear children and has killed my sense of womanhood to some extent, and much like Lilith, I feel the damnation. At the same time I recognize this damnation as a blessing, a rite of passage into the second act of my life. This is a journey of self-expression, celebrating the multifaceted layers of my identity, and embracing the beauty of growing older. I challenge my own ideas of beauty and aging, reclaiming agency over my image and my own being, reinventing myself in this process. My self-portraits recognize the complexity of a life lived, reflecting the experiences that shape who I am at this pivotal stage in my perimenopausal life. By baring myself both physically and emotionally, I allow you to witness the unapologetic celebration of my body at this time, free from constraints and expectations. These vibrant nudes serve as a declaration of self-acceptance and empowerment, going beyond ageist notions and affirming the vitality and vibrancy of life beyond youth.</span></span></p>",

I am fascinated by the form, movement and the change of the female body. Movement and dance have always been fundamental in my life. As my father was an ethnomusicologist, much of my childhood was spent in the bush listening to the sounds of marimbas, mbiras, drums and song echoing into the expansive African night. The dust from the red soil slowly rising from the stomping of rhythmic feet felt so natural and normal to me but had you seen me in this childhood picture, you would have found it strange. A child born and grown up in a society that fully embraced and accepted her despite her visible difference was transcendent. I have always felt like an outsider and insider at the same time. I live in a constant state of foreign-ship and home is nowhere and everywhere at the same time. So, the African in me continued to flourish in Sweden, I found myself dancing as a child and dancing as a mother, and that spiritual DNA flourished and was passed on to my daughters, dance is simply part of our lives. As my daughters grew, I watched how they moved, how they held themselves, and their gift of being so aware of their bodies has inspired my art. I also witnessed my daughters� struggle to fit in to their context, to fit into a society that was/is quite the opposite to how they were raised. They, like me, lived (and are living) a juxtaposed existence where the norms of their current society did not merge with those taught at home, thus creating a sense of cultural dissonance and loneliness. The confusion my daughters faced of seemingly looking like their peers, but not recognizing themselves in their peers, was difficult at times. Not until they grew older did my daughters speak out their appreciation of their difference in culture, thoughts, and actions. Today they carry their inner difference with pride.</span></p>",

We are living through a time of profound disconnection, where digital illusions and performative identities often take the place of genuine connection and truth. In this world of fragmentation and make-believe, our daughters are growing up surrounded by false mirrors. They are being shaped by forces that too often diminish their sense of worth. It is time for a new revolution, one that is quietly powerful. A revolution of remembering, of returning to what is real, embodied, and whole. My art is part of this revolution. Through painting, I reclaim a space of deep seeing, one that rejects distortion and affirms the spiritual and ancestral richness of the feminine experience. As mothers, we have an essential role in this transformation. We are not only caretakers of our daughters, but guardians of the world they will inherit. We must begin to dismantle the barriers, internal and external, that have kept us silent all this time.</span></p>",

Motherhood is clearly a multidimensional experience with as many varied perspectives as there are mothers on the planet. Personally, motherhood has been a driving force, pushing towards the creative craft of painting, allowing me space to unpack this theme. Motherhood is about exploring selflessness, empowerment, vulnerability, empathy, failure, choice, it is a source of liberation and power� and it sure doesn�t end when your children are grown-up, it changes, and changes you.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;background-color:#ffffff;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">I call my art collection �Edenfield�. Edenfield refers to a suburb in my hometown, Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, it�s where I grew up... a four hectares utopia full of bougainvillea blossoms, birds of paradise flowers, peach trees, banana trees, avocado trees, passion fruit vines and so much more. My art is my Eden, it blossoms with fields of colour and creation. It is a formation by my own hand to gift to my daughters and their daughters to come, my legacy. My �Fields of Eden� or �Edenfield�, is unlike the story from the bible that still echoes in our cultures, it is not a place of female expulsion, my story celebrates women as a constant in Edenfield. A paradise that will remain at its zenith in the future and beyond.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-9f377cff-7fff-8448-eb53-66b4b21f2f4b\"></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;background-color:#ffffff;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;\"><br></p>",

According a study done by the Tate Gallery in the UK, visitors only spend around 8 seconds looking at each painting in a gallery, which is why the initiative of �slow looking� is a focus point in my art exhibition. Within my frames I have included a source of light, revealing what I call, the spirit of the painting. This ethereal realm of light asks you, the audience to sit for a while, to gaze, to stare, to pause, to de-stress and embrace the present moment as you watch how light interacts with the painted colours on the canvas changing the original image, from one to many.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;background-color:#ffffff;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;padding:0pt 0pt 8pt 0pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">My paintings are to be viewed as the sun starts to set, outdoors in a park or a garden, as the peaceful evening curtains the sky. Using the outdoors, a garden or park as my gallery space seems a fitting place to exhibit my Edenfield collection. As you sit, sipping your wine, in my outdoor gallery at night, allow the interplay of colour and light to illuminate your perceptions, connecting art to the natural world around you.&nbsp;</span></p>",
