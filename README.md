# User Experience and Design

The site goal is to create a responsive, accessible website that showcases the art of Swedish artist Cecilia Kristoffersson. This minimalist site is intended to focus the users' attention on the works created by Cecilia, while also offering additional pages to learn more about the artist, their collections and exhibitions.

The site allows the artist to upload, modify, and delete works through the front end of the site without needing access to the Django admin panel.

Future versions of the site would include avenues for direct sale of available works by the artist, thought that functionality is not intended for the initial version of the site.
